One night, Mary was visited by the Angel Gabriel (the arch-angel) Gabriel explained that God was to send his son to earth for mankind and that Mary would soon have a baby, that baby would be named Jesus and would be Godâ€™s son. Mary was very pregnant at this time and needed to rest. Luckily, they met a kind innkeeper who let Mary and Joseph stay in 
his stable for the night. Mary gave birth to Jesus that night in the stable. She wrapped the newborn baby in a white cloth and lay him to sleep in a manger filled with hay. Shepherds on a hillside that overlooked the city of Bethlehem saw a bright star in the sky. As they watched the bright star hang over the city, an angel came down from the sky and told the shepherds that the Son of God had been born in the city and they should go to him. Mary and the newborn Jesus, and the new baby Jesus, were then taken to Bethlehem by the angels to be raised by Jesus' mother, Mary. Mary told Joseph, and they began to prepare for the birth of their son. The birth of Jesus took place in Bethlehem on the night of 
January 6th,\xa01921.

They spoke to Herod and asked to see the child that would be the King of the Jews. The wise men left Jerusalem to continue their search.
